Thanks for the pointer.\r\n\r\nI actually just got SFML2 via this Ubuntu PPA: https://launchpad.net/~sonkun/+archive/sfml-development\r\n\r\nJonathan De Wachter, the maintainer of the PPA has actually published two separate PPAs for SFML2. One called \"development\", and another called \"[experimental](https://launchpad.net/~sonkun/+archive/sfml-experimental)\".
