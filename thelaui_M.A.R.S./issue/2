It's also not necessary to check for the shader to be non-NULL before calling the method anymore, except if you want to avoid unnecessary GL calls at all when shader is NULL.\r\n\r\nAttached patch allows to use the latest version of SFML and removes the non-NULL tests before calling sf::Shader::bind().\r\n\r\nBye,\r\n\r\n-- \r\nSylvain", issueState = "open", issueId = 10218740, issueComments = 5, issueMilestone = Nothing}
